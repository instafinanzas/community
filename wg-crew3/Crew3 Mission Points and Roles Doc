I like the idea of incentivizing users to host on or provide to Akash, in exchange for AKT credits,. I think is super important we define a prize/incentives for these quests 

Quest could be adapted to support our content or other networks content on Social Media

We could plan a small number of quests and unlocked them as people progress in our community
